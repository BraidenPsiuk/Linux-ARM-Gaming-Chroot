## Installing Wine 

For those of you who don't know, Wine is a Windows Compatibility Layer for Linux/Unix. There is already an ARM package but it ONLY runs Windows ARM Programs. To get around this we can run Wine in Box86 and Box64.

Better instructions are to come for this.

### Instructions for installing Wine for Box86 can be found [here](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/blob/master/docs/X86WINE.md)

Note: Doing this may or may not break Steam. It's worth the risk to try in my opinion.
