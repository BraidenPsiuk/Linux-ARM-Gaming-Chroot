### Tested On: 

Device: `PinePhone & PinePhone Pro`

Distro: `Arch Linux Arm w/ Debian multiarch chroot`

Inputs: `Touchscreen, Dualsense Controller, Xbox One Controller, Power-A Switch Controller`

### NOTE: Touchscreen Controller input is experimental use at your own risk.

### [TabPad](https://github.com/nitg16/TabPad) must be ran from a seperate terminal.

Recommend to launch another terminal and chroot into the container again for this. You can try to run this from the host, but TabPad relies on X11 and won't launch with wayland currently. Looking into modifying or just a new touchscreen controller.
