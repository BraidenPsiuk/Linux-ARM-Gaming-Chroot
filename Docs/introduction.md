### Introduction
---------------------

First off, I have tried to make this as beginner friendly as possible. It is recommended to have basic knowledge about using the linux terminal(E.g Filesystem Navigation, View/Move/Copy/Remove files, Piping, Task Management). You can continue without said knowledge and pick it up along the way if you pay attention =).

This entire guide can be made into scripts for easy of usage. Premade scripts are in the works. No ETA!

Why a chroot container?

Well, It is quick and easy to set up. Portability isn't an issue, all while easily removable if so desired.

While there are other containers that could be used, we need both armhf and arm64. It is best to have a full set of both for best compatibility with applications in Box86 and Box64.

It is recommended to use a 128GB+ microsd card to have space for some applications and files. You can get away with a 64GB but you will have to be carefull of what you put on it.
