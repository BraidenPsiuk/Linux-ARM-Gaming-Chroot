# Games that run on the Pinephone Beta Edition (A64)

-----------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind, the Allwinner A64's Mali-400MP2 GPU only supports up to OpenGL 2.0 ( but you can force 2.1 with some applications).

This is also still ARM hardware. It is best to run on the lowest settings a game can run on.

See [Box86 Compatibility List](https://box86.org/app/) for others that might be compatible.
