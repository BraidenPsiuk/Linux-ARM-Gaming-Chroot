##Using Wine.

Wine will have to be ran from CLI (Command Line Interface). You can simply do this by running:

```
wine PATH-TO-PROGRAM/program.exe
```

It is use to configure Wine after setup. This can be done by running:

```
wine winecfg
```

Note: When a program running in Wine crashes, it can muck up for wine bottle `~/.wine`. It is best to install programs to somewhere other then `~/.wine/drive_c`.

If you need to kill a running process, head over to the next section  to get the most out of the container and for more help.
